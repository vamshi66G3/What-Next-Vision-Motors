# WhatsNext Vision Motors - Salesforce CRM Solution

## Project Overview
WhatsNext Vision Motors, a pioneering automotive company, is dedicated to transforming the mobility sector by leveraging innovative Salesforce CRM solutions. This project focuses on enhancing the customer vehicle ordering process and streamlining operational workflows to deliver a superior customer experience.

The system automatically suggests the nearest dealer location based on the customer's address, significantly improving the convenience and efficiency of the ordering process. Additionally, it proactively prevents customers from placing orders for vehicles that are out of stock, ensuring accurate order fulfillment and enhancing customer satisfaction.

An automated scheduled process updates the status of bulk order records dynamically: orders for out-of-stock vehicles are marked as ‘Pending,’ while those with available stock are marked ‘Confirmed.’ This transparency improves communication with customers regarding their order statuses.

By automating critical business processes, this Salesforce implementation reduces administrative workload and allows staff to focus on strategic tasks, ultimately boosting operational efficiency and agility.
